GitHub Repository Browser
=========================

I use Vite as my build too to initiate my project with the use of React and Redux Toolkit as my state management for data fetched with the use of Fetch API to fetch Github API data.

Building a simple search funciton with a could of filters (for coding language and star count), as well as the ability to sort results.

This is a SPA, I used React Router to handle the route for the home page and the repo details page.

I used SCSS to style the app

Tech Stack Used:
--------------

-   React 18 with Vite

-   State Management: Redux Toolkit

-   Routing: React Router v6

-   Styling: CSS3 with custom components

-   API Integration: GitHub REST API v3 using Fetch API

-   Build Tool: Vite

-   Linting: ESLint with React plugins

-   SCSS for styling

Struggles & Challenges
-------------------------

### Technical Challenges

-   The deprecation of Create React App and having to look for another build tool to start my App.

-   GitHub API Rate Limiting: Encountering rate limit errors when testing the search functionality. This was actually also a good thing because it allowed me to easily build/test the error handling for the app

-   Complex filtering for the star count

-   styled-components being in maintenance mode, which suggestions it may become deprecated so styled the app in a different manner. 

Improvements
----------------------

Given more time, I would implement the following improvements:

Adding TypeScript

-   I felt like I wouldn't have time to add typescript and finish the app within the timeframe so didn't implement TypeScript

Add styles with the use of Material UI

-   I haven't used Material UI and whilst looked straight forward enough, having worked with other component libraries in the past

Testing with Jest 

Add versioning script to update my Package,json version number with every commit

Authentication and various UI and style Improvements

-   Implement GitHub OAuth for higher API rate limits
-   Add features such as:
    -   Display number of results
    -   More search filters
    -   Page pagination

Performance based improvements:
-   As mentioned above, as pagination
-   Caching repository data to reduce API calls
-   Lazy loading repository details

Note: This application uses the public GitHub API without authentication, which limits the rate to 60 requests per hour per IP address. For production use, implementing GitHub OAuth would provide much higher rate limits and additional features.
